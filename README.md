# Connect4
Built a console-based version of the popular game, Connect Four, using Java. The program allows two players to play against each other on a board of their chosen dimensions. They take turns to place their respective chips ('x' for Player 1, 'o' for Player 2) in a selected column. The game continues until a player has four of their chips in a row or column, or until there are no more spaces left on the board, resulting in a draw. This project involved the use of 2D arrays to represent the game board, control structures for game flow, and methods for inserting chips, checking for a winner, and checking for a draw.
